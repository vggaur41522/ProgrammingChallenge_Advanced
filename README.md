# ProgrammingChallenge_Advanced
**Code one program a day**. This repository holds programs which ```doesn't``` fall under this category. 

**Why it doesn't fall in this bucket ?** Answer could be many ... 

1. Problem is simple, but LOC is scary...   
2. LOC is tiny, but to arrive at final working product require hours of brain stroming   
3. Or Just because I just OPT to make it complex by shaping it as a production line code like involving SPRINGs, Dependency Injections,involving Generics,or doing it two ways/n-ways.  Category is subjective

Programs:
1. Complex data type Tree
2. Primitive type Tree
3. In Order Traversal for both the tree styles
4. In Order Successor - BST
5. In Order Successor - Generic Tree
6. LCA - BST
7. LCA - Generic
8. Insert BST from Array
9. Insert BST : Complex Data Type with Left Child nodes tracking
10. Kth Minimum in BST - Using Priority Queue
11. Kth Minimum in BST - Using Left Child Nodes count tracking (Complex Data Type)
..... **Continued**
